## About

The project analyzed Filipino respondents interviewed for [Global Findex Survey 2017](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3324). The goal was to understand the situation of Filipinos and how they view, use, and value Financial Institutions (FIs). It was discovered that the majority of Filipinos are Financially ___Excluded___ (no accounts under FIs), and those who are Financially ___Included___ (with accounts under FIs) are underutilizing the capabilities of their accounts.

## Libraries

The project was done by compiling Jupyter Notebooks from the different contributors of the group. The creators utilized Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn, Visualization Libraries (MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Plotly), and Streamlit.
